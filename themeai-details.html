							<strong>Presentation Schedule:</strong> 9:10 am - 9:55 am<br/><br/>
							<strong>Talk Title:</strong> The Robots are Coming - to your Farm!<br/><br/>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong> What if a team of robots grew your food for you? In this talk, I will discuss some key advances in robotics, machine learning, and autonomy that could enable teams of small robots to grow more varied, tastier, and healthier food in a fundamentally more sustainable way.<br/>
Teams of autonomous small aerial and ground robots could be a potential solution to many of the serious problems that modern agriculture is facing. However, fully autonomous robots that operate without supervision for weeks, months, or entire growing season are not yet practical. I will discuss my group's theoretical and practical work towards the underlying challenging problems in robotic systems, autonomy, sensing, and learning. I will begin with our lightweight, compact, and autonomous field robot TerraSentia and the recent successes of this type of under-canopy robots for high-throughput phenotyping with deep learning-based machine vision. I will then discuss advancements to visual navigation, reinforcement learning, and onboard AI for  increasing levels of autonomy to address other pressing problems in agriculture throughout the world, including regenerating soil health and sequestering carbon with cover-crop planting robots.<br/><br/>

							<strong>Talk Title:</strong> AI in Startups: A peek into Swiggy's journey and lessons learnt<br/><br/>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong> Thanks to recent progress in deep learning architectures, current AI is typically data intensive (needs a lot of data to train a good model) and infrastructure intensive (needs powerful machines to crunch the data). The last, and perhaps the most important, component to execute AI projects successfully is a well trained AI team that understands theory, has practical problem solving skills and is exposed to end-to-end system thinking. 
When compared to conventional large established companies, in a typical startup company the emphasis is on doing more with less without compromising on the quality and speed of execution. This talk is about how we devised our AI strategy and what are the lessons we can share from our journey with the students and entrepreneurs who may be embarking on their own startup journey.<br/><br/>

							<strong>Presentation Schedule:</strong> 10:40 am - 11:25 am <br/><br/>
							<strong>Talk Title:</strong> Microsoft Premonition: Scalable Monitoring of the Biome.<br/><br/>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong>Premonition started as a research question, particularly asking, what if we could predict epidemics like we predict the weather?<br/><br/>

Disease epidemics have impacted every society and economy in human history. The key to reducing future epidemics is the early detection of potential pathogens — before they cause large disease outbreaks. This gives researchers time to develop new treatments, public health organizations time to prepare responses, and individuals time to minimize their exposure to sources of disease risk.<br/><br/>

However, detecting pathogens before they cause outbreaks is no easy task. Pathogens move through the environment in complex ways that are difficult to monitor by traditional methods. It is estimated that 60 – 75% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that jump from animals to people. Viruses like Zika, dengue and West Nile move between humans, animals, and mosquitoes in complex cycles. Yet, today we have limited technologies and capacity to monitor potential pathogens as they move through the environment.<br/><br/>

The goal of Microsoft Premonition is scalable monitoring of the environment to detect disease threats early, using robotics and genomics. Our robotic smart traps continuously monitor the environment for important types of insects, such as mosquitoes, which both transmit pathogens and collect blood samples from other animals. Meanwhile, our cloud-scale genomic analyses try to identify all the species of organisms and viruses in environmental samples to spot new transmission patterns.<br/><br/>
<strong>Bio:</strong>Sidhant Gupta is the Director of Product Incubation, a researcher, and strategist in the Health Futures Group at Microsoft. Currently he oversees the commercialization efforts for Microsoft Premonition. He also works across the organization to set the incubation and investment strategy in healthcare.<br/><br/>

Sidhant graduated with a Doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 2014 and a MS from Georgia Tech in 2009. His award-winning graduate research was built on his philosophy of “sensing everywhere without putting sensors everywhere”, that is to find ways to sense signals with minimal hardware that is easy to install and low-cost. During his Ph.D. work, he invented a device that plugs into a home’s electrical outlet that let homeowners see not just how much energy their home consumes but also how it is used – i.e. it shows power usage of each and every appliance using only a single plug-in sensor. His published work has received 10 best paper awards and nominations and has been the basis of several successful commercialization efforts. Sidhant was named one of the top 30 technology disrupters under the age of 30 by Forbes in 2014.<br/><br/>

Outside of his Microsoft roles, Sidhant currently serves as the chairman for Ideagen – an organization committed to working on the United Nations global goals, as a board member for iGIANT – a non-profit committed to ensuring that organization around the world innovate keeping sex/gender difference in mind, as an affiliate faculty in EE at University of Washington and as a General Partner at 3Force Capital, a purpose driven VC firm to help accelerate UN SDGs.</p>

							<strong>Presentation Schedule:</strong> 3:40 pm - 4:25 pm <br/><br/>
							<strong>Talk Title:</strong> AI and its application to the Future of Automated Operations<br/><br/>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong> This problem statement is particularly relevant in understanding how  to manage this new architecture of multiple microservices across the  cloud stack. Operational data artifacts span across logs, metrics,  tickets, and traces. Looking at signals across the artifacts and  across the stack presents a challenging data correlation problem. AI  mechanisms can help accelerate problem determination in these  complex environments. We focus on the problem of reactive, predictive and proactive problem determination.<br/><br/>
